### Presentation
The analysis chain required for passive acoustic monitoring consists of multiple links,
ranging from the collection of raw data to the processing of operations performed on the
transformed data. The lack of standardization in this chain complicates the technique 
required to carry it out and hinders the reproducibility of the analyses.

The OSmOSE project provides the acoustic community with open-source tools covering the 
entire chain, simplifying data processing and ensuring consistency in the analyses carried 
out within the community.
